	- Figure out tile physics, seriously.
	- TileRecord should be able to tell edges occupied by the tile.
	- TileKernel should be able to tell free edges around center tile.
	- TilePhysics should be able to map TileKernels to indexes to CollisionPolygons.
	- Implement the cell update mechanism and collision mapping by tile position.
		- Figure out best way to deal with collision surface indexes.
		- Probably just name surfaces in the construction method.
		- Remove general polygon construction for now.
	- Implement per tile material associated with the collision mapping.
	- Write PhysicsCollision class that is constructed from collision information.
